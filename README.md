U used vqfx to deploy all the stuff. Ansible workbooks are work in progress.

I made connections using port-map dictionary which i used in Vagrantfile.
I'm not sure whether it scales for a bit topology , but it works just fine and very easy to use

Please be aware that I use config file that works with my dockered ansible - particularly links to libraries.
